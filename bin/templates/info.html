			<h1>SCRUM</h1>
			<p>
				Scrum is a software development methodology. It is a set of rules or
				guidelines that are followed during the software engineering cycle. It
				is a form of agile method of software development, that is useful for
				faster development of the software by making the process of adapting to
				the changing requirements of the end-user easier and efficient.
			</p>
			<p>
				The basic principle of scrum is to develop the software incrementally.
				The development of a software is divided into a set of small tasks and
				a set of tasks is selected to be developed over a small period of time.
				The final product requirements are provided by the product owner while
				the small set of tasks to be implemented will be selected by a person in
				the development team.
			</p>
			<h2>Terminologies involved</h2>
			<p>
				There are various terminologies that are used in the scrum. The names may
				vary in usage but the core concept or principle remains same with slight
				changes.Some of the key terms that are involved are as follows:
			</p>
			<h3>Product Owner</h3>
			<p>
				Product owner is the one who wants a particular software to be built
				for a group of customers. The product owner is responsible for coming up
				with the requirements that has to be met, and also interact with the
				customers to identify any problems with the current version of the
				software and any new requirements that are not met in the current version
				of the software.
			</p>
			<h3>Product Backlog</h3>
			<p>
				Product backlog contains all the requirements of the product that are
				identified by the product owner. Product owner manages the product
				backlog.
			</p>
			<h3>Sprint Cycle</h3>
			<p>
				The software is developed over small period of cycles which varies from
				a couple of days to oen-two weeks. At the begging of the cycle, a set of
				tasks are chosen to be implemented. These tasks will be implemented
				during the current cycle. This allows the product owner to modify the
				requirements for the next cycle.
			</p>
			<h3>Sprint Backlog</h3>
			<p>
				Sprint backlog is the set of requirements that are being implemented in
				the ongoing sprint cycle. These requirements are derived from the
				product backlog. The sprint backlog changes for each sprint cycle.
			</p>
			<h3>Scrum Leader</h3>
			<p>
				Scrum leader is responsible for selecting the tasks from the product
				backlog that will be part of each sprint cycle. Scrum leader interacts
				with product owner and then selects the tasks that are of higher priority
				from the product backlog and add them to the sprint cycle.
			</p>
