Development of software goes through various phases starting from requirement analysis, product development, testing and finally deployment. Since the user requirements keep changing really fast, the product development has to accommodate to this change in requirement in the development stage of the product. In order to achieve this, we have to follow the agile method of development. One of the frameworks that put forward the agile method of development is the Scrum methodology. This application provides the features that are involved in Scrum in the form of a website.
